  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>It is important that you review this User Agreement ("Agreement") thoroughly before deciding to use XYZABC. Your use of XYZABC constitutes your acceptance to be governed by the stipulations of this Agreement.</p>
  <p>XYZABC requires your permission to periodically access websites via your device.</p>
  <p>In return for unfettered use of XYZABC, the app may utilize a certain quota of your network's bandwidth and device capabilities. To ensure the app functions correctly, it's necessary to access a small portion of your personal data.</p>
  <p>By agreeing to the data exchange, you are also indicating your agreement with our Privacy Policy (detailed below). Remember, you can withdraw from our services at any time by removing the app from your device.</p>
  <h3>Definitions</h3>
  <p>XYZABC, through its services, may utilize the idle resources of your device to gather publicly accessible web data, ensuring this process only occurs when your device is not actively in use (such as when the CPU usage is low to prevent any hindrance to your user experience or other applications).</p>
  <h3>Limitations</h3>
  <p>You are prohibited from permitting anyone to sublicense, market, rent, lend, distribute, transmit, host, externalize, or commercially exploit the app, nor may you offer it to any third party.</p>
  <h3>Changes to the Service</h3>
  <p>XYZABC may at any time change, halt, or discontinue the app or its connected services with or without prior notice to you, and we bear no responsibility to you for any such actions.</p>
  <h3>Duration and Cancellation</h3>
  <p>This Agreement is valid until ended by either you, XYZABC, or its partners. XYZABC may terminate this Agreement at its own discretion at any given time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Should you fail to adhere to any term of this Agreement, it will terminate immediately without notice. You can also terminate it by erasing the app and its copies from your devices.</p>
  <h3>Validity</h3>
  <p>Should any term of this Agreement be deemed invalid or unenforceable, that term shall be revised to reflect the original intention as much as possible under law, and the remaining terms will remain effective.</p>
  <h3>Modifications to this Agreement</h3>
  <p>XYZABC retains the right to alter or replace this Agreement at any moment at its sole discretion.</p>
  <h3>Privacy and Confidentiality</h3>
  <p>We employ standard security practices and procedures, along with internal protocols and strict standards, to guard against data misuse and leakage. Our staff and contractors have access to your information strictly on a need-to-know basis, bound by confidentiality pledges. While we implement practices and procedures aimed at mitigating the risk of data misuse, we cannot assure absolute security. Should you identify a potential security issue, we ask that you notify us without delay. We will respond accordingly, investigating and taking preventative actions as needed. As a global operator, we may need to transfer your Personal Data to different countries around the world. When this occurs, we ensure that your Personal Data receives comparable protection through appropriate legal frameworks in compliance with GDPR.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h1>Confidentiality Commitment</h1>
  
  <h3>Our pledge on privacy, in plain language</h3>
  <p>
    To put it plainly: Your identity and online activities remain unknown to us.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Your identity, contact information, website history, or application usage remains outside our knowledge.
    </li>
    <li>We do not access any identifiers that your device may already contain (like Apple's IDFA).
    </li>
    <li>Our systems do not store cookies or any tracking mechanisms on your device.
    </li>
    <li>We do not monitor your activities within an app or across multiple apps.
    </li>
    <li>Lacking any data on you, we naturally do not share information with external parties.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Essentially, to our system, every user is anonymous. We have no need for your personal details, nor do we follow your digital footprint.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sole piece of information we possess is your IP address, which we handle in compliance with data protection laws. And just for your information, every website and app you utilize is also privy to your IP address.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although we're aware of your IP, it is not utilized for ongoing business activities by XYZABC or its affiliates. Its collection is solely for legal compliance, such as validating your consent under GDPR.
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast to search engines, social media, and ad networks which require personal data to tailor advertising to you, XYZABC operates differently. We don’t display ads, collect personal data, or track your activities.
  </p>
  <p>
    We trust this sheds light on our knowledge about you. Now you are welcome to examine our comprehensive policy:
  </p>

<h3>Protection and Privacy</h3>

</p>
<p>
  While we implement robust precautions to mitigate the risk of unauthorized data access, absolute security cannot be assured. Should you become aware of a possible security risk or data compromise, please reach out to us without delay. We are committed to taking appropriate actions, which include but are not limited to investigative and preventative measures, as deemed necessary.
